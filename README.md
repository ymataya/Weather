# Weather Forecast

## Description
A weather checker that tells its users the current weather and the five day forecast of a current city. It's created for anyone who wants to know the current or future weather for a specific city so that they can plan accordingly. The design is made to look organized wherein the focus is on the current weather. Then, the future forecasts is located just below the current weather so it's easily seen, especially with its stark white color on top of a more subtle white background.

## Usage
The users can search for a city and see the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast for that particular city. The searched cities are then saved for the users' reference and are clickable in case users want to know the weather for that city again. The weather is shown with the current time and date, along with icons, humidity levels, and wind speed to give users more information.
